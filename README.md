# Multiplicative Persistence Calculator

This program was made to be able to easily find the multiplcative
persistence of any given integer. It was made in Pascal using the Free Pascal
Compiler.

In order to run the tests simply download or copy the repository
and click on the exe file or run from your command line by writing "PersistenceProgram".
If you want to modify the code and need to recompile first make sure to have the
required compiler, which can be found here https://www.freepascal.org/.
With the compiler properly setup simple write in the command line "fpc PersistenceProgram".
